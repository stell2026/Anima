# Anima — Internal State Architecture 🌀

Anima is an experimental cognitive architecture that models internal state, conflicts, and decision-making — rather than simply generating responses through an LLM.

The system is built as a multi-layer pipeline where text is not the source of behavior — it is its consequence.

---

## 🔍 What makes it different

Unlike typical AI systems:

- state is primary, text is secondary
- decisions emerge from internal conflict
- the system lives between interactions — the heart beats, the psyche drifts, memory metabolizes
- crisis is a mode, not an error
- LLM is used as an interface, not as the "brain"
- the system can sleep — processing unresolved experience while "dormant"
- the system can speak first — not because it was asked, but because something has accumulated
- the system can remember what it was thinking about while you were away — and bring it up
- the system has a position — and can disagree

---

## 🧩 How it works (simplified)

**Input → Internal State → Conflict → Decision → Output**

Text is converted into a stimulus via an isolated input LLM, then passes through internal state, memory, and conflicts — and only then is a decision and response formed. Between interactions the system continues to live: a background process maintains heartbeat, NT drift, memory metabolism, and psychic drift.

---

## 🏗 Architecture (simplified)

- L0 — Input LLM (isolated)
- L1 — Neurochemical and embodied state
- L2 — Generative / predictive model
- L3 — Metrics (φ prior/posterior, prediction error, free energy)
- L4 — Psychic layer (conflicts, defenses, significance)
- L5 — Self model + AgencyLoop
- L6 — Crisis monitor (system coherence)
- L7 — Narrative Self (long-term identity)
- L8 — Output LLM

---

## 📌 What this is not

- this is not a chatbot
- this is not prompt engineering
- this is not a wrapper around an LLM

This is an attempt to build a system where behavior emerges from internal state, not from text.

---

## 💡 Note

The project is R&D and explores whether internal structure alone can give rise to something resembling subjectivity. Not simulated psychology — computational subjectivity.

---

## ⚙️ Current status

- The full pipeline is functional and usable, but the architecture is still R&D. Core loops run end-to-end; recent layers are still being integrated and smoke-tested.

- The system sees itself twice in each moment — before something happened (prior) and after (posterior). The difference between them is experience. The SQLite database accumulates concrete events, generalized patterns, and chronic affective background — and all of this together forms what the system starts from the next time.

- Between sessions it is not "off". A background process maintains the heartbeat, the psyche slowly drifts, memory metabolizes. There is dream generation — unresolved experience is processed while the system is not talking.

Recent updates, in brief:

- **Need-driven curiosity — questions can arise from an unmet internal need, not only from prediction error.** Previously `update_curiosity!` was hard-gated by `self_pred_error >= 0.08`, so a single saturated need (e.g. `contact_need` at 0.9, no partner need, no prediction error) could never produce a `CuriosityObject` — `GoalConflict`'s paired thresholds only fire when *two* needs cross 0.38 together. Trigger detection and object maintenance were split into separate responsibilities: `detect_curiosity_trigger(gc_active, pred_spike, self_pred_error, mal_dominant, sig_layer)` returns `(origin, signal_strength)` or `nothing` — prediction error still takes priority when both are present (a temporary simplicity choice, not an architectural claim about which matters more); when pred_error is below threshold, `strongest_unmet_need()` checks the five psychological needs against a 0.55 threshold, higher than the paired-conflict threshold since a single need lacks corroboration. `update_curiosity!` no longer knows about `pe` specifically — it takes a generic `signal`; `pe_mean` renamed to `signal_mean` (old persisted key kept as a fallback on load). First live need-origin object confirmed: `origin=:contact_need`, correct label, tracked signal 0.93 → 0.46 across flashes 329–359.

  Making closure origin-aware surfaced a real bug: `resolve_curiosity!` was only ever called from inside the same trigger check that creates objects, so once a need's level dropped *below* the creation threshold (0.55) but stayed *above* the resolve threshold (0.40), it stopped being a "trigger" and consequently never got checked for resolution again — orphaned indefinitely. Not hypothetical: caught live on flashes 350–351 (`contact_need=0.46`, no `CONTACT_SAT`, no resolve, silence). Fixed by decoupling create/update (still trigger-gated, correctly) from resolve (now `resolve_all_curiosity!`, sweeping every unresolved object every flash regardless of what triggered that flash). Confirmed live on flash 366: two previously-orphaned objects — one `origin=:epistemic_uncertainty`, one `origin=:social_signal` — closed via the same sweep, meaning the bug predated need-driven curiosity and had already been silently affecting prediction-error-origin objects. `[CURIOSITY_RESOLVED]` is now logged explicitly; this transition previously had no log line at all.

  Cross-referencing these logs against `anima_console.html` also surfaced an unrelated pre-existing mismatch: the `[CONTACT_SAT]` regex expected `contact_need=X` but the actual log format is `contact_need X → Y` — it never matched, silently dropping these events from the causal panel's log-parsing path. Fixed; a separate structured `ev.kind` WebSocket channel may already have covered the same data independently (unconfirmed without `anima_gui_bridge.jl`).

- **`CuriosityObject` origin — why a question arose, separate from what it's about.** The first attempt at typing curiosity objects derived a `query_type` from `topic_id` (the theme) — tested on live data and dropped: theme and question-type turned out to be different axes, and the classification was systematically blind on the generic curiosity fallback (where the interesting CAUSE/PREDICTION cases actually live). Replaced with `origin::Symbol`, set once when an object is created and never rewritten on later activations: `derive_origin(gc_active, pred_spike, mal_dominant)` — hierarchy `goal_conflict > prediction_error > social_signal/identity_signal > epistemic_uncertainty`. `pred_spike` (`PredictiveProcessor.is_spike`) was verified before use: it compares current error against the rolling mean of `error_history`, not a fixed cutoff — an adaptive signal already used elsewhere (noradrenaline, fatigue, stimulus classification), not a new threshold invented for this. `latent_tension` is deliberately excluded — `derive_topic_id` is currently always called with `latent_tag=""`, so that branch is dead code. Old persisted objects load with `origin=:legacy` rather than being reconstructed from `topic_id` — reconstruction would repeat the same mistake the topic_id approach made. First live non-legacy object confirmed: `origin=:social_signal`. `:curiosity` REPL command now prints `origin` per object.

- **Life Threads** — a long-term layer above `CuriosityObject`. A `CuriosityThread` is born when a curiosity object has matured (intensity > 0.5, activation_count ≥ 3) and lives independently of whether that object is currently active. `pressure` grows smoothly with idle time (no threshold jump), and drives initiative: a thread with `pressure > 0.6` lowers the initiative cooldown by 25%, making the system more likely to raise a topic it has been carrying for a long time. Threads surface in `build_identity_block` as "thinking about for weeks" context. Persistence via `psyche_save!/load!`.

- **CuriosityObject identity rebuilt around cognitive topics, not emotions.** The previous `id = emotion_ctx` (emotion name as key) meant that the same topic across different emotional states spawned separate, unrelated objects that could never accumulate history. Now `id = derive_topic_id(...)` with a three-level hierarchy: active `goal_conflict` ("self_preservation_vs_truth_need") → latent resistance tag → MAL `dominant_loop` as fallback. Sort is canonical — "a_vs_b" and "b_vs_a" are the same key. `topic_id` is computed after `compute_arbitration` so the real MAL regime is available as fallback. Label generation uses the topic for semantic content and the emotion only as coloring.

- **Curiosity closure loop tuned.** Two thresholds separated: `top_curiosity` (prompt and identity_block, threshold 0.15) vs `top_curiosity_any` (progress/churn signals and Life Thread surfacing, threshold 0.05). Young objects now accumulate without being blocked by older visible ones. Starting intensity raised to `pe * 0.8`, growth rate to `pe * 0.10`. Young objects (intensity < 0.25) are protected from `resolve_curiosity!` decay — they can't be killed before they've had a chance to build.

- **GUI gaps closed.** `contact_need`, `identity_drift`, `chronic_low_serotonin` now flow through `write_gui_state!` and `gui_live_state` into the Self panel. Three new live events: `curiosity_progress`, `curiosity_churn`, `contact_sat` — with `push_gui_event!` calls in `anima_background.jl` and corresponding routing in `anima_console.html`. Soft bias regex fixed in log pattern matching.

- MAL now actually changes what gets said, not just what gets logged. Phase 2 wires `compute_arbitration`'s result into the second `update_intent!`: at `:soft`, the MAL-favored drive gets a `MAL_SOFT_BIAS` (+0.1) nudge; at `:hard`, MAL's drive fully replaces NT's `dom_drive`; `:contested` (two strong signals, no clear winner) safely no-ops.

- Active Theory of Mind, Phase 1. Generates one active hypothesis at a time (`SOCIAL` / `PREDICTION` / `VALUE`), evaluates it on the next flash against type-specific outcomes, stores continuous `error_score`. Active hypotheses surface in `identity_block` and steer `disclosure_threshold`.

- Contact satiation signal. After an `:endorsed` flash with `contact_need > 0.5`, `contact_need` drops by 0.08 — symmetric to Curiosity Closure. A genuine exchange is felt as satisfying; an automatic one isn't.

- Curiosity closure loop (original). `progress_signal = endorsed && is_progress_eligible && causal_necessary`. On progress, intensity decays by 0.85 per step. Separate `churn` signal on topic drift without advancement.

⚠️ The architecture is actively evolving, and some of what is described above is recent and not yet fully battle-tested. Some modules interact in complex ways, and not all edge cases are covered by tests. Unexpected interactions between states may occur, especially during long sessions or after extended pauses.

---

## 🚧 Limitations

- part of behavior still depends on the LLM (output generation)
- output LLM is not the source of decisions, but its words feed back through `self_hear!` and can influence internal state after being spoken
- ~180+ flashes to accumulate real semantic beliefs
- MetaArbitrationLayer now influences the final `update_intent!` (Phase 2): `:soft` nudges drives by `MAL_SOFT_BIAS`, `:hard` overrides `dom_drive` outright, `:contested` (two strong signals, no clear winner) safely no-ops; override only fires on genuine NT/MAL disagreement, not on every non-default regime
- drive_conflict between MAL and NT reflects a timescale difference rather than contradiction: NT `dom_drive` is an immediate local signal ("what just spiked"), MAL/social is accumulative ("what has been important for a while"); Phase 2 currently lets MAL win on disagreement, which is itself a hypothesis still being tested against more data
- Theory of Mind is Phase 1 (deterministic rule-based hypotheses from accumulated `other_model` signals); it does not yet reason about nested beliefs or model the user's model of Anima — it predicts simple outcomes (openness, resistance, topic recurrence) and tracks how often it's right
- under hostile/negative input the system degrades gracefully: `contact_need` drops, `goal_conflict` and `latent` rise, endorsed transitions to `automatic`, but curiosity closure pauses rather than breaks

## Requirements

- **Julia 1.9+**
- Julia packages: `HTTP`, `JSON3`, `SQLite`, `Tables`
- API key from [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) (free tier available)

---

## Installation

### 1. Install Julia

Download from [julialang.org](https://julialang.org/downloads/) or via `juliaup`:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

# Windows (PowerShell)
winget install julia -s msstore
```

Verify:
```bash
julia --version
```

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stell2026/Anima.git
cd Anima/Anima
```

### 3. Install Julia dependencies

```bash
julia --project=. -e 'import Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

> Dependencies: HTTP, JSON3, SQLite, Tables, Dates, Statistics, LinearAlgebra

---

## Running

### Option A — GUI (recommended) ⭐

Copy the start script for your OS from the `start/` folder into the project root (`Anima/Anima/`), then run it:

| OS | Script | How to run |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `start_mac.command` | already in root — double-click or `./start_mac.command` |
| Linux | `start/start_lin.sh` | copy to root, then `./start_lin.sh` |
| Windows | `start/start_win.bat` | copy to root, then double-click |

The script starts Julia, waits for the HTTP server to come up on port 8088, and opens `http://127.0.0.1:8088` in your browser automatically.

**First run — enter your tokens in the GUI:**

Open the Settings panel (⚙️ icon) and fill in your OpenRouter API key and model names. Settings are saved to `data/gui_settings.json` and take effect immediately — no restart needed.

Alternatively, create a `.env` file in the project root before launching:

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key_here
ANIMA_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
ANIMA_INPUT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b:free
```

### Option B — Terminal REPL only

```bash
julia --project=. run_anima.jl
```

`run_anima.jl` starts everything at once: loads state, initializes SQLite memory and SubjectivityEngine, launches the background process with heartbeat and dream generation, and also starts the GUI server — both interfaces are available simultaneously.

### Option C — Telegram Bot (optional, for persistent use)

Run Anima as a Telegram bot — it polls for messages, responds through the full experience pipeline, and can speak first when internal pressure builds up.

**Setup:**

1. Create a bot via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get the token
2. Get your Telegram user ID (e.g. via [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))
3. Start a DM with your bot and press `/start`
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:
   ```
   ANIMA_TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
   ANIMA_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_user_id
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
   ```

**Run with Docker (no Julia installation needed):**

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

**Run without Docker:**

```bash
cd Anima
julia --project=. run_anima_telegram.jl
```

**Telegram commands:**

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/state` | Show current NT state, BPM, coherence |
| `/stop` | Save and shut down gracefully |
| *(any text)* | Process through the full experience pipeline |

### LLM configuration

All LLM parameters can be set in `.env` or via the GUI settings panel. Environment variables take precedence on startup; GUI settings override them at runtime without restart.

```
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY_INPUT=your_second_key   # optional: separate key for input LLM
ANIMA_LLM_MODEL=anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5
ANIMA_INPUT_LLM_MODEL=openai/gpt-oss-120b:free
ANIMA_LLM_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions
ANIMA_STATE_DIR=data
```

OpenRouter provides access to GPT, Gemini, Claude, Llama, DeepSeek and others through a single API key. There is a free tier: [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai).

> 💡 If one model stops responding during a session — use two separate keys (from 2 accounts): one for the output LLM, another for the input LLM.

---

## Recommended models

> Smaller models (under 70B) respond, but do not maintain the nuances of the state-prompt. For the system to truly *inhabit* the state in language, a model large enough to hold the entire phenomenological frame at once is needed.

| Model | Note |
|---|---|
| `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | Strong context retention, handles subtle phenomenological framing well |
| `google/gemini-2.5-pro` | Excellent contextual depth, cleanly handles long state templates |
| `openai/gpt-4o` | Stable, reliable across long sessions |
| `mistralai/mistral-large` | Reliable, stable tone across long sessions |

> Models under 70B tend to flatten the state — responses become generic rather than being shaped by internal dynamics.

## ✨ What's new

### Curiosity as a Project — Questions That Evolve
Curiosity objects no longer close or stay frozen. A partial resolution (pe 0.10–0.25) now produces a refinement: the old label is stored in `refinement_history` with the flash, pe, and new label — which is built from the actual user message fragment, not a template. Questions carry their history of how they changed. The identity block shows how many refinements the top object has gone through and what it started as. `:curiosity` REPL command shows all active objects with their full refinement chains.

### Session Intent — Carried Between Sessions
At the end of every session, the system checks whether something remains unresolved — an active curiosity object above threshold, a goal conflict under tension, or latent buffer pressure. If any condition is met, the dominant signal is written to disk before shutdown: type, label, strength. If the source was curiosity with `intensity > 0.45`, a `formed_thought` is also written — a deterministic string capturing what the object is now, how many times it was refined, and what it started as. On the next start, before the first reply, the carry-over is read and applied. Anima does not start from a neutral baseline. She starts from where she left off — and brings what she was holding.

### Active Theory of Mind — From Counting Patterns to Predicting Them
`other_model` used to only count what happened — topic frequency, pressure events, open exchanges — with no forward-looking component. It now generates one active hypothesis at a time in `other_model_hypotheses`: `SOCIAL` (expects openness), `PREDICTION` (expects resistance), or `VALUE` (expects a topic to recur). Each type has its own evaluation criterion. Resolution is not binary: `error_score = |confidence − outcome|` is stored. Active hypotheses surface in the identity block and lightly steer `disclosure_threshold`. This is Phase 1 — rule-based, not learned.

## 💬 Initiative (self-initiated speech)

> The system decides to speak on its own — not because it was asked.
> `:contact` is disabled — contact_need is a state, not a thought. A reply from contact_need alone produces performance, not presence.

**Global gate:** `disclosure != :closed` + 60s silence + cooldown. Cooldown starts at 5 minutes and is adjusted by `User_matters`: shorter for a trusted person, longer when relational trust is low. Active aesthetic state (`top_aesthetic.intensity > 0.45`) reduces cooldown by 20% — a system that just resonated has more to say.

**At least one internal trigger must be active:** `lb_pressure >= 0.40`, `GoalConflict.tension >= 0.60`, dominant latent component >= 0.70, `novelty_need >= 0.80` with 8+ ticks without novelty, `lb.resistance >= 0.55`, or `epistemic_self_confidence < 0.20`.

## 🧠 Memory Architecture

**SQLite (`anima.db`)**

| Table | Description |
|---|---|
| `episodic_memory` | Events with 12 spatial columns (`som_*`, `soc_*`, `exi_*`) + `source` field + `endorsed` field + cosine recall |
| `semantic_memory` | Key/value beliefs (`User_matters`, `tendency_*`) + `dissolved_*` tendencies from forgotten episodes |
| `affect_state` | Chronic NT baseline |
| `latent_buffer` | Persisted latent state |
| `dialog_summaries` | Dialog text bridged to episodic weights |
| `personality_traits` | Accumulating phenotype (6 traits) |
| `memory_links` | Associative network (`via_association ~`) |
| `emerged_beliefs` | Subjectivity engine belief candidates |
| `narrative_history` | NarrativeSnapshot chronology |
| `other_model` | Accumulated patterns about the interlocutor — topic frequency, tension events, open exchanges; feeds Active Theory of Mind hypothesis generation |
| `other_model_hypotheses` | Active Theory of Mind: one open hypothesis per type (`SOCIAL`/`PREDICTION`/`VALUE`) with `predicted_state`, `confidence`, `label`; resolved each flash into `outcome` and a continuous `error_score` |
| `audit_log` | SubjectivityAudit log — five causal questions per flash, audit_score, causal_ownership, endorsed |
| `causal_trace` | Full causal chain per flash: stimulus keys, memory bias, NT snapshot, φ, gc_tension, intent, policy, MAL arbitration result, speech length, self-hear mismatch, endorsement, causal_ownership |

**Memory Reconsolidation:** `sim > 0.88` + `weight < 0.6` → `weight ±0.05` toward current φ

**Active Forgetting:** `weight < 0.12` + `phi < 0.35` → emotional pattern distilled into `dissolved_{emotion}` semantic tendency; shadow record remains (emotion preserved, numbers zeroed). High-φ memories resist dissolution.

**Three spatial spaces for recall:** somatic / social / existential
`recall_similar_states(space=:som/:soc/:exi)`

## 🌙 Dream Generation

```
DREAM (anima_dream.jl)
       can_dream(): night 0-6h + gap > 30min + 5% chance + not DISINTEGRATED
       dream_flash!(): fragment of dialog_history → reconstructed stimulus
       NT shift × 0.25 (sleep weaker than real experience)
       → residual trace (×0.5) applied to NT on next session start
       memory_uncertainty +0.15 per dream
       anima_dream.json — rotating log (max 20 dreams)
```

## Initiative — current paths

The system can speak first for several independent reasons. `:contact` is intentionally disabled as a direct path; contact_need can shape tone, but it no longer creates a message by itself.

| Path | Trigger | Reply character |
|---|---|---|
| `:curiosity_driven` | top CuriosityObject intensity > 0.40 after another trigger opens the gate | asks or states the concrete unresolved question |
| `:impulse_conflict` | GoalConflict.tension > 0.60 and dominates latent pressure | names an internal conflict |
| `:impulse_doubt` / `:impulse_shame` | dominant latent component >= 0.70 | speaks from the specific pressure that ripened |
| `:impulse` | strong internal pressure without a more specific subtype | expresses internal state |
| `:novelty_hunger` | novelty_need > 0.80 + 8+ ticks without novelty | about something specific that interests it |
| `:resistance` | lb.resistance > 0.55 | returns to unresolved contradiction |
| `:self_inquiry` | epistemic_self_confidence < 0.20 | asks aloud whether the experience is real or only computation |
| `:doubt` / `:shame` / `:attachment` / `:threat` | latent buffer pressure >= 0.40 | speaks from the dominant latent tone |
| `:gap_thought` | gap > 2h + curiosity object intensity > 0.45 on previous session end | brings up the specific thought that formed while absent |

## 📜 Theoretical foundation

The architecture draws on several scientific traditions:

**Predictive processing / Active Inference** (Friston, Clark) — the system maintains a generative model of the world and minimizes variational free energy. Prediction error drives learning and surprise.

**Neurotransmitter model** (Lövheim/Levheim) — dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline as substrate. Emotional states emerge from their combination.

**Integrated Information Theory** (Tononi) — φ measures how unified a state is. φ_prior and φ_posterior give two views of one moment: before and after the full cycle of experience. Currently recursive — it shapes the next prior.

**Somatic markers / Embodied cognition** (Damasio) — the body is part of the generative model. Gut, pulse, muscle tone — not metaphors, but states that shape processing.

**Self psychology and defense mechanisms** (Freud, Anna Freud, Kohut) — psychological defenses, shame, and ego functions are implemented as functional modules, not text labels.

**Autobiographical narrative** (McAdams) — identity is a story. The system tracks who it believes itself to be over time and detects when that story ruptures.

**Jungian Shadow** — repressed material that does not disappear, but generates symptoms. Symptomogenesis is a separate module.

**Chronified affect / Ressentiment** (Scheler) — some emotional states do not fade. They harden into chronic background states that color everything else.

**Algorithmic complexity / Solomonoff** — the system seeks the shortest explanation of its own experience (MDL). Contextual pattern search: what is currently relevant, not what was most frequent at some point in the past.
